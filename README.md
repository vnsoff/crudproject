# CrudProject
<h2>About the project</h2>
<p> ðŸ’» Access index.php in the folder crudphp, and indexprod.php in the folder Views of crudigniter</h3>
<p> âœ¨ It was implemented two CRUD (Create, Read, Update e Delete), the first using vanilla PHP and the second, using a PHP framework, CodeIgniter 4. </p>
<p> âœ¨ In both, Bootstrap and a little Javascript were used. </p>
<p> âœ¨ The database used was Mysql as requested, installed through xampp. </p>
<p> âœ¨ The structure of CRUD in PHP was composed of a main index file and one for each operation of each table, with CodeIgniter 4 the structure is a little different, the tables are on different pages, there is a controller, model and index for each table.</p>
<p> âœ¨ The data types used in Mysql were INT with autoincrement for the ID, VARCHAR for the name in the two tables, BIGINT(14) for the CNPJ, INT for the value and finally ENUM predefined for the status instead of BOOLEAN because it was more efficient.</p>
<p> âœ¨ The crud in pure PHP is working 100% without pending issues, while the crudigniter that uses CodeIgniter 4 as a framework, there is a pending update of the data, which I am still identifying another way to fix this issue.</p>
